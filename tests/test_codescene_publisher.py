"""Contract-test where the CodeScene token may appear in the publisher.

The upload is ``upload-codescene-coverage``, a composite action. A composite
action's nested steps inherit the calling step's environment, so a token bound
in the upload step's ``env``, or the job's, or the workflow's, reaches every
step inside the action. ``coverage-main.yml`` therefore keeps the token out of
every ``env``. A check step publishes only whether the token exists, the
upload's guard reads that output beside the main-ref guard, and the upload
takes the token directly as an input.

The positive half matters as much as the prohibition. Deleting the token keeps
every ``env`` clean while the upload's guard goes false and publishing silently
stops, so the token's sites are held to exactly the check's command and the
upload's input.
