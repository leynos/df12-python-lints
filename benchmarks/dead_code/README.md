# Dead-code detector benchmark

This directory contains the reusable, tool-neutral corpus and normalizer for
the pyscn and Skylos comparison. It is development evidence, not part of the
shipped package or its runtime. It was moved here from the Episodic repository,
so that no consumer keeps detector benchmarking code; the retained results name
the Episodic checkout they were captured against, which this repository does
not contain. The `df12-skylos` gate runs Skylos; these benchmarks are the
evidence for that choice.

`corpus/` is a deliberately small Python project. Its own `pyproject.toml`
bounds project-root discovery without configuring either detector. The source
contains intentional unused and unreachable code, so each corpus module uses a
file-level Ruff suppression to keep repository lint separate from benchmark
ground truth.

`expectations.json` is the oracle. Each entry labels one source location before
scanner output is considered, assigns it to either the `unused-symbol` or
`unreachable-statement` lane, and explains why Python semantics make it live or
dead. Add a new label only when its liveness can be decided without trusting a
scanner. Do not change a label merely to make a detector result pass.

The `score.py` module is intentionally specific to the two released JSON
schemas captured by this comparison. Reuse it for reruns of this corpus; add a
separate parser when evaluating a different detector rather than disguising
schema differences inside an existing parser.

`results/` retains the tool output, wall-clock metadata, normalized scores, and
repository-scan adjudication from 2026-07-27. The large repository reports are
compressed with deterministic gzip metadata; their SHA-256 digests are in
`production-adjudication.json`. Absolute checkout prefixes in the Skylos report
were replaced by `./` before compression, so the retained evidence does not
depend on one workstation path. Finding content was otherwise unchanged.

Run the corpus commands from `benchmarks/dead_code/corpus/`:

```bash
uvx pyscn@1.28.0 analyze --select deadcode --min-severity info --json .
uvx skylos@4.30.0 . --no-upload --no-provenance --confidence 0 --no-grep-verify --format json
```

Run the practical comparison from the root of an Episodic checkout, since the
target is Episodic's `episodic/` package rather than this repository:

```bash
uvx pyscn@1.28.0 analyze --select deadcode --min-severity info --json episodic
uvx skylos@4.30.0 episodic --no-upload --no-provenance --confidence 0 --no-grep-verify --format json
```

The elapsed times are single wall-clock observations, not performance
benchmarks. They are retained to expose order-of-magnitude differences only.
